// one tree gives one result at any time. It compares the manifests and locks with the policy
// config/dependency-policy.json and with the review record config/dependency-review.json, which the developer command
// `make dependency-review RECORD=1` writes from the registries. It reports every finding with the rule that the finding
// breaks and its fix, one line each, and fails when there is one.
