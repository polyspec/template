// The dependency gate of the verification suite (T18.10): `make dependency-policy-check`. It reads only files of the
// checkout and queries no registry, so one tree gives one result at any time. It compares the manifests and locks with
// the policy config/dependency-policy.json and with the review record config/dependency-review.json, which the
// developer command `make dependency-review RECORD=1` writes from the registries. It reports every finding with the
// rule that the finding breaks and its fix, one line each, and fails when there is one.
